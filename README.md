# PVZ-GW1 Modding on Linux

To mod *Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare* on Linux, you'll need to install the game to a Wine prefix that resides on an NTFS file system. Unfortunately, there isn't a Frosty build out there that's compatible with both GW1 and Linux. (I've asked brekko and yeah he doesn't really care much about Linux support and I can't really blame him for that.)
